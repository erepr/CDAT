- A TabNet Classifier model is trained with this input data upon which an inference is made from patients input data.

- Prediction is made on the patients symptoms data, and thereby initiate them to take timely medical assistance.

- Disease severity is classified as: very well, fair to good, poor and very poor.

- A severity score is computed which ranges from **100 to 450**. Those **below 100** are classified as doing **very well**, between **100 to 200** as **Fair to Good** and those **above 200** as doing **very poor**.
